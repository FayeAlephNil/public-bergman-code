# Accompanying Code to the Generalized Bergman Game Paper

This code was developed by the members of the SMALL 2021 REU in order to explore the Bergman Game and related questions concerning Hamming distances and Base Phi Decompositions.

- main.cpp/zeckGame.cpp: Code required to run the Bergman Game itself. Was used for collecting numerics on random games and for initial exploration of certain strategies
- HammingDistanceComputer: Computes hamming distance of base phi representations
- greedy_phi.py: Greedy algorithm for computing base phi representations
- phinary.py/qu: Quick way of computing base phi representations using the Recursive Structure Theorem (Dekking)
- train.sage: Used to explore a certain variety of game states called "trains" and "cogs."
- Matlab.nb used for data collation
